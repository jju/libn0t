# librarianaut media

Librarianaut Media is a small endeavour specializing in creating audio and video content for libraries (public, academic and related fields). Our catalogue of content includes screencasts, podcasts, and live-action videos (our animation skills are rudimentary so we stick to slideshow-style Lego videos).
