# librarianaut media

Librarianaut Media is a small endeavour run by J Jack Unrau that specializes in creating audio and video content for libraries (public, academic and related fields). Our catalogue of content includes screencasts, award-winning podcasts, and live-action videos. Slideshow-style LegoÂ® videos are one of J's favourite (and most economical) formats when live humans don't need to be on screen.

## videos

Video production for libraries can take many forms. J has created video booktalks, demonstration screencasts (to supplement more detailed instructional materials), library profiles and even recreated library programs for people who couldn't attend in person.

## podcasts

When J worked for the Vancouver Island Regional Library he was part of the team producing Librarians on the Radio, a monthly radio program and podcast that won a BC Library Association Advocacy award and an award from the American Library Association.
