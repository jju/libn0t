# about us

And when I say "Us" I mean me, J Jack Unrau.

Most relevantly to Librarianaut Media, I've been trained as a journalist and a librarian. The upshot of this meandering path is that I bring a librarianly perspective to my storytelling, and media-creation skills to my librarianing. I did an internship with CBC Radio many years ago and learned how to get good audio, which means that as libraries have been dipping their toes into media creation those skills have been ever more useful.
