> This is the text of a talk I gave at the 2018 Netspeed Conference in Sherwood Park, Alberta. I have included the abstract but not my little bio. Footnotes are post-hoc commentary.

Tech help is an area of public library service that can be fraught. In our efforts to ensure the library remains relevant to the public we can embrace helping our users with technology, teaching them how to use the little slabs of silicon and light in their pockets. We can point to this as success, as the library's relevance being reinforced, as part of an empowering mission of library workers.

But that goal of individual empowerment often comes at the cost of obscuring systemic complexity, and when it does what does that obfuscation cost us as a community?

At Strathcona County Library we've tried to broaden our approach to find room for discussing politics and ethics within our tech programs. In this presentation we'll talk about how we try to help the public grapple with the meaning behind their digital tools while they're struggling with their settings.[^1]

[^1]: This writeup came at the beginning of months of thinking and reading. At that point I was still thinking it would be more of a practical kind of session than what it eventually became. There was a draft of this that dealt more specifically with the tension inherent in this kind of work, and I think that might have ended up being a better frame.

# ethics and politics in public library tech help

Welcome. I'm Justin Unrau (or J Jack Unrau if you know me from the internet, don't worry I will answer to whatever) and I'm the Digital Literacy Librarian at Strathcona County Library.[^2]

[^2]: I'm still not used to my employer being okay with me saying where I work when I'm off talking in public.

Just for a tiny bit of background on me, I grew up Mennonite in Manitoba, where one of my grandfathers was a preacher on the socialist end of the spectrum who was good at challenging non-Mennonite society and my other was a farmer who was a much fiercer individualist capitalist who was good at challenging his Mennonite community.[^3] And both of my grandmas were awesome caring people, and are probably the examples I try to follow more in my everyday work.

[^3]: In the world where I had put in all the work on this talk slowly and surely over the course of months I would have had pictures of these grandparents. But I had a lot of trouble deciding if this bit mattered at all. It was out of the talk until the night before because of my varied qualms. I know I wanted to do it because it is important to me, but I also know that it is something inidigenous scholars often do. I should probably have made it clearer that I don't think I'm doing anything special with this, and really, my talk didn't have anything to do with being Mennonite, not the way that Jessie Loyer's WILU 2017 keynote had to do with her heritage. So I don't know if this was an appropriative thing. It probably was. And I left out the colonialist aspect of my socialist grandfather's ministry so I probably shouldn't have said anything about this at all.

I let you know all this because this whole talk distills a lot of my reading through my experiences and I know these familial examples I grew up with have shaped these thoughts.

# digital literacy

When I try to describe the kind of librarian I am, I usually tell people something along the lines of "I'm the kind of librarian helps people with their glowing slabs of silicon for free." Depending on the audience and on how impressive I'm trying to sound that can change a bit, but really that's the essence.

Now a short description like that for what I think digital literacy is leaves a lot out, which is fine. But I think it's important to note that though my view of digital literacy is the kind of tent that fits a lot of circus elephants, it covers the three core elements to what I want my job to be. The "glowing slabs" is the technology that makes my job a bit more focused than some other library workers' but the important things for today are the "helps" and "for free" because right there I've got my ethics and politics embedded.[^4]

[^4]: Everything is so vague here. I needed to rework the sentences to say something about how help

# politics and ethics

This combination of ethics and politics is important to me because it is part of a larger conversation in librarianship. I see very smart people talking about how libraries should or shouldn't be hosting Nazis or doing displays about Pride in Utah and those stories fall under the banner of libraries and neutrality.[^5]

[^5]: Piggyback piggyback piggyback on things that sound relevant but are really just allusions without the specificity I'm about to say I'm trying to get into.

## libraries are not neutral

I agree with the statement that libraries are not neutral entities, nor should they be.[^6]

[^6]: I don't know why I needed to put in the word entities. But this is where I could feel things moving away from the original writeup. Am I trying to do a Libraries Aren't Neutral talk, or a Why We Do Digital Literacy talk? It felt important to acknowledge this discussion in larger librarianship, but it's at the cost of focus.

In the past I've tended to put my opinions out there on what libraries need to do in general, but as I mature as a librarian I've needed to reflect on and connect what our library does, and what I *specifically* do, with the wider ideas. Connecting library tech help to the question of whether libraries should be neutral was the spur to the thinking I'm going to tell you about today.[^7]

[^7]: That it has taken this many slides of introduction is a failure. Where is my concision and getting to the point? The takeaways?

## three writers on library non-neutrality

These are three articles I'd recommend if you are thinking that well, libraries are/should be neutral. They are all smarter people than me and have better, more specific reasons for why they support that position.[^8]

* Chris Bourg - [Debating y/our humanity, or Are Libraries Neutral?](https://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/2018/02/11/debating-y-our-humanity-or-are-libraries-neutral/)
* nina de jesus - [Locating the Library in Institutional Oppression](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2014/locating-the-library-in-institutional-oppression/)
* Emily Drabinsky - [Are Libraries Neutral?](http://www.emilydrabinski.com/are-libraries-neutral/)

[^8]: I really do think these are three great things to read about library neutrality and how it is a privileged and incorrect thing to think about. I'm a cishet white dude so it's easy for me to default to "neutral" status quo kinds of positions, since they benefit me. I worry here about whether I'm doing enough to offset me being a cishet white dude just by saying "Read these writers who are not like me!" Am I sharing my speaking stage, or am I trying to get credit for what these smart people have said and done, just by acknowledging them?

In the third of these bits Emily Drabinski (who's a union organizer and reference librarian) shifted the question from "Should libraries be neutral to..."

## meaningful access to life

> "How, concretely and materially, do we deploy our power to produce material worlds that give all of us meaningful access to life?" - Emily Drabinski, [Are Libraries Neutral?](http://www.emilydrabinski.com/are-libraries-neutral/)

In my experience, librarians aren't really good at talking about power in the everyday.[^9] But we have it and wield it and the way in which we wield it can have concrete and material effects on our users and the world.

[^9]: And again we have one of these statements tossed out there without any backup. This is something that if I had been doing serious work on this, I'd have sources to cite.

# digital literacy values

Even in the slightly less material realm of "help with technology" we are constantly making choices about the kinds of help we provide. These choices are shaped by a number of things, including the skills of library workers, what we have the funds and staffing to provide, but also by more explicitly political concerns like protecting the library from litigation, and satisfying the world-defiling corporations that fund us. But they are also driven by "librarianly values" whatever they are. So what are librarianly values?[^10] Do we have the ability to live out those values?

[^10]: From [the ALA website](http://www.ala.org/aboutala/): In pursuing our mission, the Association’s core value statements define our deepest aspirations and how we approach our work together. They are Extending and expanding library services in America and around the world - All types of libraries - academic, public, school and special - All librarians, library staff, trustees and other individuals and groups working to improve library services - Member service - An open, inclusive, and collaborative environment - Ethics,[^11] professionalism and integrity - Excellence and innovation - Intellectual freedom - Social responsibility and the public good

[^11]: A word buried in the middle of the core values, after extending and expanding services. That fucking growth mindset as if that is all that matters, that stewardship of the services isn't important. It's so vague and meaningless or part of capitalism.

## an opaque status quo

> When our future is opaque, it is harder to envision the specific conditions of life we will face tomorrow that can be improved by following an ethical principle or rule today, and such ideals may then fail to motivate us. - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

Digital literacy (at least in our library's plan of service and my job description) has to do with teaching and empowering our library users to deal with this technology-driven world.[^12] One of the big problems we have in library technology help is the power imbalance between the library user and the gigantic corporations that are providing these services.[^13]

[^12]: This would be a good place to actually list what our library says about digital literacy. Our strategy says "Strathcona County Library is a destination for Strathcona County residents who want to learn, share, create and connect in a rapidly evolving digital environment. - Patrons and staff share ideas and expertise in an enthusiastic community of learning. - All staff members facilitate and support patrons’ opportunities to build skills to access, evaluate, analyze, create and connect using digital resources. - Staff members are not expected to be experts in everything, but they will be comfortable assisting patrons in a co-learning approach."

[^13]: I think it might be useful to draw out the distinction between library technologies and the rest of the silicon-based world here, rather than leaving it for the end where I diss the library workers who don't want to help with the rest of it. The gigantic corporations include Google and Facebook, yes, but also Overdrive and Western Digital. People who sell to librarians aren't librarians themselves and they are trying to parasite off of our values to clean up their profit-seeking goals.

Part of the reason why we need to provide this help to users and hence support this technology-driven status quo is that the system we buy into (with our money) and support (with our teaching) is opaque to our users. Large corporations set the rules and we teach people how to think within those systems. This is the big education project we are engaged with: teaching users to be compliant with systems they don't understand. Adobe Digital Editions isn't something we created so it's not our fault,[^14] but we do keep on paying for the system that requires it so it kind of is.

[^14]: In the live presentation this line drew cheers and (small) whoops which felt nice at the time, but makes me wonder now. Just saying that the tool we pay a lot of money for sucks shouldn't be cheerworthy. We all know that and we should be saying it all the time, while we try to figure out something better. But we don't! We just keep shovelling money at our vendors hoping they will fix things, make them easier. I don't want to go all Randian here, but if we aren't going to make a meaningful attempt to do things differently (through developing our own alternative that actually allows people meaningful access to the information we're being sold, or possibly engaging in some civil disobedience by breaking those terms and conditions we agree to without a fucking thought) don't we deserve the face-smooshing we get from the monied bullies we coexist with?

## status quo politics

We tell people it's easy! and tap away, demonstrating the ease with which you too can share your life with Google for its profit. Or we struggle through and we give our instruction on how to borrow ebooks but not how to make them usable on a device the corporation we sign agreements with doesn't approve for them. Do your users know why they have to wait for someone else to be "done using a file" before making a copy they can read? Have they thought about why that is actually crazy?[^15] Even if we're (laudably) teaching users how to secure their information using the tools we have, it turns out that Facebook is using the 2FA phone numbers to serve advertisements.

[^15]: I've been decrying DRM on library ebooks my entire career (such as it is) so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that I'd work it in.

We're teaching people how to fit into a political system where the entities with money have authority, and our only options are to complain or not to use these systems at all (assuming you're fine with leaving digital life behind). Is compliance with authority a librarianly value? If we go by our actions, yes, yes it is.

## serving customers (up on a platter)

But why are we doing this? What are we trying to achieve with all this digital literacy/help with technology? Isn't the (also bad) alternative to say "not my problem," which seems irresposible? Don't we want to help our community members, even if they're doing things that aren't in their best interest like being on Facebook?

I think it's easy for us to slip into a customer service model where we're looking for a happy user at the end of our interaction. Library workers are helpful. We generally like to help. We help our library users better than we help our family when they have the same questions. This is what we do.

But doing this is a choice. It's a political choice, and an ethical choice and those are all tied together and we need to think about these choices more rigorously than we currently do. It's not a neutral choice to facilitate user interactions that aren't in their best interests.

Here's the thing that keeps me up at night (or did before we had a baby) that goal in our service plan of individual empowerment comes at the cost of obscuring systemic complexity.

## obscuring complexity for "happy" users

I think people, our users at least and most likely us tech-helpers too, want things to be easy. We've trained ourselves into thinking that easier is better. That only weirdos want things to be more complicated.[^16] But the simplicity of a Google interface hides all sorts of complicated interconnected shit. This opacity, this difficulty in seeing what is happening in an interconnected world is what is preventing us in the digital realm from being able to help access life meaningfully.

[^16]: In the live talk this is where I plugged Code4LibYEG as just that sort of weirdos. I meant that in an affectionate way, and as the talk goes on, I think it's clear that I am on the side of the weirdos.

We can’t just be aiming for happy customers. It cheapens everything.

If we're trying to get meaningful access to life—at least the parts of life that are related to digital technology—we need to get people fluent in the language of privacy and security and advertising and propaganda in a way that they don't want to (or more likely, don't have time to) hear.

People want an easy app to install to protect them from the "dangers of the internet" but there is no such app because the biggest danger of the internet would be whoever funded that app.

## neoliberal responsibility

> There is, however, an important difference between companies in the mold of, say, Houghton-Mifflin as opposed to one like Google. The former, presumably, is not trying to nurture cradle-to-grave consumers of social studies textbooks. The latter has a very strong interest not only in training the workforce of the future in G Suite, but also in forming positive and powerful brand associations in the minds of its littlest consumers. ... By focusing solely on personal choices, the program suggests that the power to protect personal information lies entirely within one’s own hands and locates responsibility for doing so with the individual. - Joanna Petrone, [Google's Got Our Kids](https://theoutline.com/post/4436/google-classroom-education-free-software-children-school-tech)

When we help a person navigate the bizarre and byzantine labyrinth of the many apps the library uses, we are telling them that their user experience is something that we aren't responsible. We pay our vendors to do things (each in their own different way) because that is easier. For us. And apparently that is what is important.

When we show people how to sign up for Facebook we are—even if we tell them about the privacy implications of turning over life and conversation to Mark Zuckerberg—we are saying that there *is* a good way to use Facebook, a way that doesn't support evil. I get asked sometimes by new Facebook users, so what do I do with this? And I say I don't know. Facebook is a shitty simulacrum of life. I hate it so much.

Even the notion of the user just needing to educate themself or not use the product is part of a neoliberal political project.[^17]

[^17]: Another statement with no backup. Here is where we need to talk about neoliberalism and how it is antithetical to what I think a library's goal is. Talk about Karen Nicholson at WILU 2017 and her great stuff. Maura Seale.

## limitless morality

We are stuck in a status quo that pretends to be simple because that is what is profitable, not what is of value. A shallow education in "what works" is a matter of throwing people into a thresher, not providing them meaningful access to life.

> “It is an old story. Evil is offering us the world: “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” And we have only the old paradox for an answer: If we accept all on that condition, we lose all. What is new is the guise of the evil: a limitless technology, dependent upon a limitless morality, which is to say upon no morality at all. - Wendell Berry, [The Unsettling of America](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=unsettling+america&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+berry+wendell+date+1996+title-complete+the+unsettling+of+america+culture+agriculture+medium+book)

So this is sounding biblical and I have to apologize because like I said before one of my grandfathers was a preacher and my grandma told stories.

## practical wisdom

> What distinguishes the well-cultivated person or phronimos from those who are morally ordinary is how reliable and accurate his faculty of moral attention has become, as a result of habitual moral practice and considerable experience. The practically wise will notice and respond to morally significant phenomena to which the rest of us will often be oblivious or indifferent. - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

But what are our values and how do we educate people in these values? If we take Emily Drabinski's question from before as our guide I think we end up at something like Shannon Vallor's Technomoral Virtue Ethics.

This is a great concept that isn't specifically about libraries, but one of the goals in there is to have more technomoral education available for people. And part of being virtuous is having exemplars to follow. I think there is nothing more useful for librarians to do than to actually be the virtuous technosocial actors that we could be.[^18]

[^18]: And here we're in the realm of the missed opportunities of this talk. I wanted to talk about the idea that our service requires blending with human values and how that implies the work itself isn't part of those values. I wanted to talk about how vocational awe drives us to a mirror hellscape of the whole blending our life and work and how bad that is when the work isn't made more like our life instead of vice versa. "How did such a possibility become thinkable? It seems to me that it is implicit in the modern separation of life and work. It is implicit in the assumption that we can live entirely apart from our way of making a living. It is implicit in the idea of the agricultural engineering students at South Dakota State University that their farm-of-the-future would require "blending with human values."" - Wendell Berry, [The Unsettling of America](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=unsettling+america&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+berry+wendell+date+1996+title-complete+the+unsettling+of+america+culture+agriculture+medium+book)]

# technomoral virtue ethics

So Shannon Vallor's book *Technology and the Virtues* is great. In her view, the best way to deal with technology is through the lens of virtue ethics. This is the idea that the way to be an ethical person is to try to act the way an ethical person would. The book looks at Aristoelian, Confucian and Buddhist virtue ethics as possible models for what technosocial virtue ethics could look like, and oh my glob is this ever a better model than vague ALA statements.[^19] Virtue ethics assume that you can't just make a simple rule to follow and remember because the world and its circumstances constantly change and we need to approach situations *specifically*.

[^19]: See footnote[^10].

Vallor points to two aspects of technomoral ethical life: virtues and practices. While the virtues are good ways of thinking of what an ethical person looks like, the practices are more complex and are where education comes in.

These kinds of traditions make a distinction between what children can learn and what grown adults can, and one of the big things is to cultivate good habits and approaches that can be applied flexibly to the changing situation of life.[^20]

[^20]: Obviously this entire section should be expanded upon, but for a talk, I felt this wasn't a terrible summary.

## seven technomoral practices[^25]

1. moral habituation[^21]
2. relational understanding[^22]
3. reflective self-examination
4. intentional self-direction of moral development[^23]
5. perceptual attention to moral salience
6. prudential judgment[^24]
7. appropriate extension of moral concern

[^21]: Not mindless habits but doing things in a particular way with a reason. This practice accustoms the person to better action.

[^22]: Ethics aren't autonomous (as in Kant or utilitarianism); we have roles in our relationships. How do our actions affect others around the globe?

[^23]: What technologies help and which inhibit becoming the kinds of people we want to be (I see this arena as the big fight against marketing)?

[^24]: There are no fixed rules that can simply be applied without judgment. Even if we can build one, the algorithm cannot rule the virtuous library. "... how can we keep our deliberative skill from being exercised outside of practical wisdom, in ways that serve the interests of personal, national, or corporate exedience rather than the broader aims of human flourishing in our techno-social environment" - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

[^25]: Obviously these are all from Shannon Vallor's [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

To get into just one of these practices (see the footnotes for brief descriptions of a few more, let's look more closely at #7.

> ... a very simple norm—extend your existing moral attitude of concern from its natural or current target(s) to all those who deserve it—is nevertheless one of the most challenging moral habits to practice. Of course one general source of difficulty is determining who deserves our moral concern, and how much of it. - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

When we express more concern over fulfilling our license agreements with our vendors over getting a library user access to the community of readers she yearns to be a part of, what does that say about our appropriate extension of moral concern?

## twelve specific virtues for technosocial life[^25]

1. honesty - respecting truth
2. self-control - becoming the author of our desires
3. humility - knowing what we do not know
4. justice - upholding rightness
5. courage - intelligent fear and hope
6. empathy - compassionate concern for others[^26]
7. care - loving service to others[^27]
8. civility - making common cause
9. flexibility - skillful adaptation to change[^28]
10. perspective - holding on to the moral whole[^29]
11. magnanimity - moral leadership and nobility of spirit[^30]
12. technomoral wisdom - unifying all that

[^26]: In this system, compassion is something we learn to feel and is part of why we practice.

[^27]: This is one of those virtues that I think library workers can do, but can also get burned out on super easily. "We become moral selves largely by teaching ourselves to actively respond to and meet the needs of others..." But if we are the only moral actors in the technology sphere that's putting too much on the library worker.

[^28]: This is beyond a "live and let live" approach, heading towards active deliberation together with others in order to agree upon prudent courses of technosocial action. There will be conflict but we are all actually in this together so that conflict is good. Vallor talks about different cultural approaches towards privacy here.

[^29]: Scaling our moral desires even if there is no one scale. Our actions support or dismantle global projects nowadays, so a larger perspective than the shallow practical "how do I make this work?" is what is necessary.

[^30]: This speaks to the unearned moral trust we have in librarianship. We need to actually try living up to this shit that people think we are doing, even though we can't even protect our users' privacy from Adobe data breaches.

We can talk (and Vallor does) about how each of these virtues can be brought to bear in technosocial life, but let's just point out two that apply directly to the tech help we provide at the public library.

Humility is so important. Trying to bring in the idea of kindness and empathy into technology work is on of the most important things we can do. Especially if we are trying to help people on to a deeper understanding of the power structures that shape this world of technology we need to acknowledge that it isn't easy. That of course I know I should be using Tor for my normal internet use but I don't because of the lag it induces on a connection. It takes a lifetime to be better. and we're always going to fail and it's always going to suck and it will always feel like the world is collapsing and we should just go find a mountain to die on with a nice view.

And civility, working together and not being fragmented into our neoliberally isolated individual consumer modes is another big one. Like yes, library workers should be unionized, but we should also be making our common cause with our users to wield our power. It's not about the glowing slabs. Here's Vallor again:

> This reflects a fundamental error in the thinking of Shirky and other heralds of a digital civic renaissance such as Kevin Kelly, Jeff Jarvis, Eric Schmidt, and Nicholas Negroponte: the assumption that you will get a thriving civil society simply by supplying citizens with the proper tools. ‘If cooperative and fruitful civic action online is not forthcoming,’ so the thinking goes, ‘then we obviously have not yet given our wouldbe citizens of the global digital polis the right instruments with which to construct it.’ The mantra seems to be: if we equip them, they will build it. What is missing is any attention to the particular civic characters, motivations, and capacities of the ‘them’ in question. The collective desire, skill, and virtue necessary to cooperatively wield new media technologies for civic aims are all (wrongly) assumed by this model. - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

## concrete and material

So let's get back to the public library's role in trying to live out these values, which I think are more specific than anything you'd find on an ALA statement.

I believe public libraries need to be Vallor's "practical spaces for technomoral education".

# technomoral education

> ... places where people may apply the habits of moral self-cultivation to the contemporary challenge of living well with emerging technologies, and the inevitable surprises awaiting us in our technosocial future. Technomoral education must eschew passive learning of fixed rules and the associated ‘compliance mindset’ in favor of active habituation and practice across a variety of technosocial contexts, fostering habits of technomoral reflection, the study of technomoral exemplars, and the skills of moral discernment and judgment needed to adapt and flourish in new and evolving technosocial circumstances. - Shannon Vallor, [Technology and the Virtues](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=technology+and+the+virtues+vallor&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+vallor+shannon+date+2016+title-complete+technology+and+the+virtues+medium+book)

## types of public library tech help

So we come down to applying this stuff. In our library we do a couple of general kinds of tech help.

1. Something is broken / Why isn't this working?
2. Something is new / How do I use ...?

And then there's the hierarchy where we look at whether it's a library thing or a rest of the world of technology thing. Generally I think library workers prioritize the library stuff whether it's fixing broken stuff or teaching the use of stuff. But there are clear cases where the other world of technology comes into play — [last year's Netspeed keynote](https://librarytoolshed.ca/content/netspeed-2017-keynote-digital-readiness-and-other-digital-divide-strategies) Jessamyn West's example of needing to go online to get a hunting licenses being a good one.

## a technomoral education lens

At our library we are getting more and more "I have a lot of photos online. What do I do with them?" kinds of questions. So let's try applying Vallor's aspects of technomoral education:

1. active habituation and practice across a variety of technosocial contexts
2. fostering habits of technomoral reflection
3. the study of technomoral exemplars
4. developing skills of moral discernment and judgment needed to adapt and flourish in new and evolving technosocial circumstances

It's not exactly a library topic, but library workers do have ideas on how to deal with something like that (because we’ve practiced it, #1). I love these ones because they're a great opportunity to show users that organizing things takes time (#2), even if often that time is hidden from us. Sometimes you will just need to do a pile of work, and decide for yourself if it's worth it (#4). And the "easy" alternative is for Google to facially recognize everyone in your photo library automagically, which is easy but still squicks people out (sort of an anti-#3).

I think all four of those aspects of technomoral education can be brought into the mix regardless of whether something is broken or something is new.[^31]

[^31]: Again, this is something that could be fleshed out with a bunch of case studies and better, more specific examples. But this was just a talk, not a book.

## what we do for digital literacy at my library

We do classes for the "how do I..." kinds of questions and we do one on one (1o1) appointments, drop-in sessions and the general stuff you do on desk at a library for the "this isn't working" kind of stuff.

One of the things we've been moving towards is an embrace of the learning together approach (putting that virtue of humility to good use) and tackling more of the wider world of technology. I think it's irresponsible for us to say "because we pay for Overdrive we will help you, but we don't pay for Instagram so tough luck" just because it is more difficult to learn something new and hurts our pride to not be an expert.

Virtues like humility aren't just a nice idea but foundational to empathizing with our users. And this is where my real anti-customer-service ideal comes in.

Yes, the user who has their issue promptly resolved in an efficient manner by an expert is pretty good "customer service" it isn't developing skills of moral discernment in our users. Arguably it could be a "providing exemplars" kind of thing but only if the tech helper is talking through the things they are trying.

Even though it might not be obvious from my desire for library workers to be technomoral exemplars, I hate the use of language like tech gurus and experts. These words are such bullshit and it's something we need to remove from our marketing - even though that's a political bit of messaging that libraries love because it's trying to show our relevance. But fuck relevance if we aren't being kind.[^32]

[^32]: This paragraph got dropped from the talk due to time. It was an aside prompted by me being introduced as the tech saviour especially when I am in our rural communities. This is also where the sexism of library tech help rears its head, which I didn't talk enough about in this piece.

Anyway. I think it's important for us to work with the complicated weird edge cases of non-library technology as well as library specific stuff like Adobe Digital Editions because the whole thing behind virtue ethics is that if we want to improve the world we have to model the behaviour we want more of and that's most effective to do in the helping with a problem kind of interaction.

## political programming

> That which makes the Luddites so strange, so radical, and so dangerous is not that they wanted everyone to go back to living in caves (they didn’t want that), but that they thought that those who would be impacted by a new technology deserved a voice in how it was being deployed. - The Luddbrarian, [Why the Luddites Matter](https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2018/01/18/why-the-luddites-matter/)

Beyond helping fix things that are broken, we do occasional programs about more traditional politics in this realm -- I try to make sure we do something around labour and organizing for May 1. We try to bring up the interconnectedness of all things in our classes, about how all these tools and apps just exist to sell more glowing slabs of silicon filled with rare earth metals.

Do we connect the use of all this stuff enough to the threat of climate change? We could do more. I do make sure to use my leftcoast self as an example of someone who hates the companies like Enbridge that fund my library while they destroy our planet for profit, and connect that to a reason why I might prefer to keep my communications hidden from a government that wants to build pipelines I would rather be dismantled. It's important to connect tools like Tor and Signal to their civic use.

# the end

> Technofatalism isn't logical; it's a highly destructive failure of imagination & unwillingness to resist the status quo. It's the sullen twin of technophilia. Both assume tech can & will determine society. It's not that simple. We have a fighting chance. But we have to fight. - Marie Hicks [@histoftech](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/web/status/1005049998529191936)

I guess that's about what I wanted to talk about. I think that putting our values into our tech help is important and I think it can be done practically, mostly through working through things reflexively and telling the truth about the ways our systems work and trying to be better, and not just empty "better" but better in these specific virtuous ways.

I think people are better served by being told that things are complicated than they are by having false confidence in their ease with using technology. I know that it doesn't look good in the stats when everyone who comes to the library ends up being more rather than less agitated about the technosocial world we live in. For me, I do try not to engage in Hicks' technofatalism, but in order to get people to fight against these systems that could be so great if they weren't being used in the most shallow[^33] stupid totalitarian ways, we need people to understand.

[^33]: I dropped another quote from the slidedeck here in favour of the totalitarianism one in the next section: "The standard of practical education, on the other hand, is based upon the question of what will work, and because the practical is by definition of the curriculum set aside from issues of value, the question tends to be resolved in the most shallow and immediate fashion: what is practical is what makes money; what is most practical is what makes the most money." - Wendell Berry, [The Unsettling of America](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=unsettling+america&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+berry+wendell+date+1996+title-complete+the+unsettling+of+america+culture+agriculture+medium+book)

## reading list

> “But it is imperative to understand that this sort of intelligence is tyrannical. It is at least potentially totalitarian. To think or act without cultural value, and the restraints invariably implicit in cultural value, is simply to wait upon force. This sort of behavior is founded in the cultural disintegration and despair which are also the foundation of political totalitarianism.” - Wendell Berry, [The Unsettling of America](https://talonline.ca/#media=book&query=unsettling+america&recid%5B%5D=content%3A+author+berry+wendell+date+1996+title-complete+the+unsettling+of+america+culture+agriculture+medium+book)

This hasn't been a research project. I apologize for the lack of rigour, but I'm hoping this has been at least a little bit provoking of thought. If I were an academic I'd have more of a literature review, but as it is I've got a reading list that helped bring me to this talk if you want to see some sources and come to different (probably more rigorous) conclusions. Warning that they might all seem a bit miscellaneous, but these have all affected this talk.

Thus endeth my sermon.[^34] Thanks very much for listening.

[^34]: Other things I would have liked to talk about in this sermon: stripping DRM from library ebooks as a practical ethical service, intellectual freedom within library work[^35], and dealing with the "I may agree ideologically but professionally, this is not the place" kind of resistance.

[^35]: "We should ... insist on dealing with the huge problem in our profession of the intellectual freedom of public library workers being sacrificed in favour of a liberal hegemony or the market (the library’s “brand”). An intellectual politics would insist on trying to live up to our values, even if we fail." - Sam Popowich, [Intellectual Freedom and Virtue Ethics](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/09/11/intellectual-freedom-value-ethics.html)
